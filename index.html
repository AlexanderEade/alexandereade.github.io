        <p>Hello! I’m Alex Eade. This page shares what I’m into and why. The HTML code for this website was generated with ChatGPT by asking it to give me a simple HTML website using the instructions in the assignment. However, I added in my personal information and tweaked it to fit what I wanted to put on here.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a student who enjoys learning new tools and exploring technologies.
            When I’m not studying, I love spending time on the activities below.

            <summary>Gaming</summary>
            <p>
                I currently still enjoy gaming after growing up with it. I love the competitive nature of most games and I actually am rank 1 in the United States in a gamemode called Surfing from Counter Strike Source (although its present in the new games).
                I started out with Call of Duty but I have always been a competitive player since I started.

            <summary>Music</summary>
            <p>
                I listen to a lot of Rap/Hip-Hop and R&b. I have been to a lot of concerts and saw artists such as Travis Scott, Lil Tecca (who I'm seeing again this Thursday), 21 Savage, JID, and many more. It has always been a way for me to reflect on myself and enjoy music. 
            </p>

        <details>
            <summary>Technology</summary>
            <p>
                As a technology focused major, it is pretty natural that I love technology. However, I am very passionate about it and I spend a lot of my freetime diving into new technologies that sound cool to me. As a networking background, this can be new protocols that I haven't used before
                or new hardware that I haven't worked with. I also love learning about automation and building things how the big companies do it. That part excites the problem solver in me.'

    <!-- ===== GitHub Explanation ===== -->
    <section id="github">
        <h2>GitHub Explanation</h2>
        <p>
            When creating this website, we started by creating a Github repository to host our HTML files. GitHub Pages allows us to serve static websites directly from our repositories, making it easy to share our work with others. A branch is
            just a separate version of the repository where we can make changes without affecting the main codebase. This is useful for testing new features or making updates without disrupting the live site. In my case, I just stuck to the "main"
            branch since I wasn't making any major changes that needed to be tested first. A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the codebase at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and a message that describes the changes made.
            This is useful when needing to look at a specific version of the code or when collaborating with others. Overall, using GitHub and GitHub Pages has been a great way to learn about version control and web development.
